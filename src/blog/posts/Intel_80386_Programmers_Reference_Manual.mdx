# Intel 80386 Programmer's Reference Manual

## About This Manual

### Origins

The original source of this manual (INTEL386.TXT), as far as I can tell, is an official Intel source document. I found the original document somewhere on the net (I don't remember where). You can get the original source document from
[here](http://www.kingsnet.com/~lance/i386/i386txt.zip) (212K)
(link current as of 3/97).

This hypertext version of the source document, obviously, is not an official Intel document or product. You can download the entire hypertext-ed manual from [here](http://www.kingsnet.com/~lance/i386/i386htm.zip) (2??K)
(link current as of 3/97).

## Purpose

I converted the manual to html because:

1. I needed a basic 80x86 instruction reference,
2. the latest and greatest format of the manuals are huge PDF files (on the order of 3-4meg each) and are a pain to sift thru with Acrobat,
3. I thought it would be a fun project.

## Character Set

Because the original document used the extended PC character set, I decided to stick with it as much as possible. At one point, I converted everything to standard ASCII, but found that some characters were muddled in the shuffle. So ... to properly display the tables and some of the other characters, your browser must be using the MS LineDraw character set. In Netscape 2.0, use Options/Preferences/Fonts/Fixed Font-Choose Font. Select MS LineDraw. I use a font size of 10.
